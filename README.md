#  Personal Website v2.0

A complete re-write of my personal website. Aside from the new layout, visible changes include a more responsive design (due largely to the use of SASS this time around), a new journals section, and different ways to navigate through projects (ie. tags and dates). Most of the changes however come from the switch from using vanilla PHP to the CakePHP framework. Projects and journals are stored in a MySQL database.
