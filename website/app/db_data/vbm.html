VBM uses Google Analytics to collect traffic data. This includes data such as user interactions within the app, devices used and location (granularity is limited to city). The data is not personally identifiable. VBM uses  Google Analytics purely to determine the usage of the different areas of the app. This will allow me to determine which areas of the app I should target for future updates. Crashlytics is also used to to send back logs in the event of a crash. This includes information about the device the crash occured on (ie. iOS version, orientation, system usage). This information is used to allow me to respond to crashes as they happen.

<h2> FAQ </h2>

<div>
	<p class="regular"> How do I add the same game on multiple platforms? </p>
	<p> Once you have added a multi-platform game to a platform, it can be added to another platfrom via the Add Games section of the app. Search for the game again, select 'Add' and then select the second platform. You can add the same game to all avaliable platforms. You cannot add the same game on the same platform twice. </p>
</div>
<div>
	<p class="regular"> What is the difference between the Backlog and the Full Backlog? </p>
	<p> The Backlog includes games that you have not beaten and are not playing. The Full Backlog includes games that you have not attained 100% completion in and are not playing (regardless of wheather the game is beaten). </p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="regular">  I'm trying to add a game but some of the data is missing (ie. platforms). </p>
<p>
The app currently uses the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/games/">GiantBomb Wiki </a> for game data. A few games in the Wiki are missing data. Should you encounter such a game, feel free to let me know and I’ll update the Wiki. Alternatively, if you don’t feel like waiting for me to fix it, you can also update the Wiki yourself by creating a GiantBomb account, finding the game with the missing data, and making the associated edits. 
<p>

<div>
<p class="regular"> I'm trying to add a game but the app says the game has been already been added on all available platforms. </p>
<p>
This is the same issue as the above question and occurs when the GiantBomb Wiki is missing platform data for a game. 
<p>

<div>
	<p class="regular"> How do I edit a game I added?  </p>
	<p> Once you have added a game, you can edit the game by accessing it via the Library, Now Playing or Backlog sections of the game.  This is slightly different behaviour than versions of the app prior to v1.2 where a game could be edited regardless of which section of the app you were in. This change comes as a result of adding the ability to add the same game on multiple platforms in v1.2. With v1.2 a game can only be added via the Add Games section, and only edited/deleted via the Now Playing / Backlog / Library sections of the app. </p>

<h2> Version History </h2>
<p class="regular spaces"> v1.2  ·  Jan 30, 2014 </p>
<p>
I've added the ability to add the same game on multiple platforms. A lot of people asked for this one! In order to support this, the behaviour of the app has been slightly changed. You can now only edit a game via the Now Playing, Backlog, or Library sections of the app. You can only add games (not edit them) via the Add Games (formerly Search) section of the app. This is because the same game has different stats/data for different platforms.
<br> <br>
In addition, images are now cached on disk so you should see fewer placeholders, especially on the Now Playing screen. I've also added a FAQ section.
