<h2> Controls </h2>
<ul>
	<li>W, A, D keys to move the character.</li>
	<li>Left click to build a block. Right click to remove it.</li>
	<li>Press SPACE to flip the map.</li>
	<li>Press ESC to pause the game.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Rules </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Coins can only be collected when the map is not flipped. </li>
	<li> Blocks can only be built when the map is flipped. </li>
	<li> Coins are reset each time the map is flipped. You must build the map in such a way that you can collect all the coins in one go. </li>
</ul>

<h2> State of Project </h2>
<p>
I built this game as a way to familiarize myself with SDL and the basics of game development. The game has a major issue where the jump distance is dependent on the computer the game is run on. I didn't notice this issue until tried the game on a Windows 8 laptop. Most Windows 7 computers should run the game fine.  I haven't resumed worked on this game since I finished it (summer 2012), and don't plan to revisit it.
