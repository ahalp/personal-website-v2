	<p> <b> How do I add the same game on multiple platforms? </b> </p>
	<p> Once you have added a multi-platform game to a platform, it can be added to another platfrom via the Add Games section of the app. Search for the game again, select 'Add' and then select the second platform. You can add the same game to all avaliable platforms. You cannot add the same game on the same platform twice. </p>

	<p> <b> What is the difference between the Backlog and the Full Backlog? </b> </p>
	<p> The Backlog includes games that you have not beaten and are not playing. The Full Backlog includes games that you have not attained 100% completion in and are not playing (regardless of wheather the game is beaten). </p>

<div>
	<p> <b> How do I edit a game I added? </b> </p>
	<p> Once you have added a game, you can edit the game by accessing it via the Library, Now Playing or Backlog sections of the game.  This is slightly different behaviour than versions of the app prior to v1.2 where a game could be edited regardless of which section of the app you were in. This change comes as a result of adding the ability to add the same game on multiple platforms in v1.2. With v1.2 a game can only be added via the Add Games section, and only edited/deleted via the Now Playing / Backlog / Library sections of the app. </p>
